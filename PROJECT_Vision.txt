# Project Vision: The Single-File Manifesto

## 1. Core Philosophy: Simplicity, Portability, Longevity

This application is, and must always remain, a single, self-contained HTML file. This is not a limitation; it is our core design principle. The vision is to create a powerful, immersive experience that is maximally portable, requires no installation or build steps, and can be run offline by simply opening one file in a web browser.

This approach ensures:
*   **Ultimate Portability:** The entire application can be shared as a single file.
*   **Zero Dependencies:** It runs without needing `npm install`, a web server, or a complex development environment.
*   **Offline First:** The app is inherently functional without an internet connection.
*   **Longevity:** Free from the churn of frameworks and build tools, this app is architected to work for decades to come.

## 2. The Golden Rule: One File to Rule Them All

All code—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—must reside within the `index.html` file. The app is intended to be a standalone HTML page that can run from a single file without external dependencies or resources.

## 3. What This App Is NOT

To maintain clarity and focus, it's essential to define what we are not building:

*   It is **NOT** a Single Page Application (SPA) in the modern framework sense.
*   It is **NOT** a multi-page website.
*   It does **NOT** have a backend or server-side component.
*   It does **NOT** require a package manager or a build step.
