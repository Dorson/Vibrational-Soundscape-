Vibrational Soundscape — A Multi-Stage Generative Audio Experience
Vibrational Soundscape is a lightweight, browser-based web application that creates an immersive, multi-stage audio environment. Using the Web Audio API, it generates a unique "soundscape" designed to guide the listener through different mental states, from a grounded and focused mindset to a blissful and transcendent one.

This project is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it highly portable and easy to run. No server-side dependencies are required—just open the index.html file in your browser to get started.

Features
Multi-Stage Progression: The application features a five-stage audio journey:

Grounding: A deep, resonant hum to establish focus.

Energetic: Adds dynamic, tingling textures.

Mental: Focuses on clarity with polished mid-band tones.

Intuitive: Shifts to frequencies associated with alpha and theta brainwaves.

Bliss / Transcendent: A final stage of harmonic bloom and ambient sounds.

Dynamic Sound Generation: The core engine synthesizes various audio layers, including binaural beats, ambient pads, pink noise, and isochronic tones. These elements smoothly ramp up or down to minimize jarring transitions.

Interactive Visualizer: A real-time visualizer animates to the audio waveform and displays a series of rings and dots that indicate the current stage.

User Controls: Easily adjust the session length and overall intensity. You can also toggle the isochronic gating and pink noise layers on or off.

Automated and Manual Modes: Choose to either run a fully automated session or manually step through each stage at your own pace.

Safe and Simple: The app is designed for minimal distraction and includes a safety disclaimer. Headphones are recommended for the full effect.

How to Use
Simply download the index.html file and open it in any modern web browser.

Start Auto: Click this button to begin an automated session that progresses through all five stages over the set session length.

Next Stage (manual): Click this to manually advance to the next stage of the soundscape.

Pause/Resume: Suspends or restarts the audio.

Stop: Stops the session and resets the application.

Sliders & Checkboxes: Adjust the Session length and Intensity using the sliders. You can also disable Isochronic gating and Pink noise with the checkboxes.

Developer Notes
This project is a great example of what can be accomplished with vanilla web technologies. It showcases:

Web Audio API: The core of the application, used to programmatically generate and manipulate audio.

Canvas API: Powers the real-time audio visualizer, providing an engaging user interface.

Pure JavaScript: All the logic, from audio processing to UI interaction, is handled without external frameworks or libraries.

Feel free to fork the repository, experiment with the code, and build upon the sound engine. The STAGES constant is easily modifiable, allowing for quick experimentation with different frequency profiles and beat patterns.
